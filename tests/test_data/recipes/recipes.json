Gently toss with apples and lemon juice.Roll out 1 piece of dough (keep remaining piece chilled) on a lightly floured surface with a lightly floured rolling pin into a 13-inch round. Fit it into a 9-inch pie plate. Trim edge, leaving a 1/2-inch overhang. Refrigerate while you roll out dough for top crust.Roll out remaining piece of dough on lightly floured surface into an 11-inch round.Spoon filling into shell. Cover pie with pastry round and trim with kitchen shears, leaving 1/2-inch overhang. Press edges together, then crimp decoratively. Lightly brush top of pie with egg and sprinkle all over with remaining 1 tablespoon sugar.  With a small sharp knife, cut 3 vents in top crust.Bake Pie on hot baking sheet for 20 minutes.

For a single crust pie or tart, drizzle 3 tablespoons ice water evenly over mixture and gently stir with a fork (or pulse) until incorporated.Squeeze a small handful of dough: if it doesn't hold together, ad more ice water 1/2 tablespoon at a time, stirring or pulsing until incorporated. Do not overwork dough or pastry will be tough.Turn dough out onto a work surface. For a single-crust pie or tart, divide into 4 portions; for a double-crust pie, divide into 8 portions. With heel of your hand, smear each portion once or twice in a forward motion to help distribute fat. Gather all dough together, with a pastry scraper if you have one. For single-crust pie or tart, press into a ball, then flatten into a 5-inch disk. For a double-crust pie, divide in half, and then flatten each into a 5-inch disk. If dough is sticky, dust lightly with additional flour. Wrap each disk in plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, at least one hour.Cook's note: \nThe dough can be refrigerated for up to 1 day.From The Gourmet Cookbook edited by Ruth Reichl (Houghton Mifflin Company, 2004)Print Recipe", "datePublished": "2004-10-20", "prepTime": "", "description": "101 Cookbooks: Apple Pie Recipe"}

Heat the oil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add the garlic, cumin, coriander, cayenne, and turmeric. Stir well, and saute for just 15-30 seconds, or until the spices are toasted and fragrant. Transfer this mixture to a medium mixing bowl and stir in the water, tahini, yogurt, lemon juice, and 1/4 teaspoon of salt. Taste and adjust to your liking - you most likely will need a bit more salt. Set aside.\nSalt the pot of water generously, and boil the broccoli, cauliflower, and green beans. Boil just 30 seconds, and quickly fish out with a slotted spoon. Run the vegetables under cold water to stop cooking. Drain well and set aside in a large mixing bowl.\nReturn the water to a boil and add the pasta. Cook until al dente, then drain and run under cold water. Really try to shake off any extra water, then add to the vegetables. Add the tomatoes, and toss gently. You can toss with half of the sauce at this point, or serve the salad with dollops of the sauce on top - to be tossed at the table. It's prettier this way. Sprinkle with the basil/cilantro (and basil flowers if you have them) and serve. Serve the extra sauce on the side - any leftover makes a good dip later in the week.\nAdapted from the Pasta Salad with Tangy Sesame-Yogurt Sauce in Peter Berley's The Modern Vegetarian Kitchen.\nPrep time: 10 min  - \n   Cook time: 10 min   \n  \nPrint Recipe", "url": "http://www.101cookbooks.com/archives/sesame-yogurt-pasta-salad-recipe.html", "image": "http://www.101cookbooks.com/mt-static/images/food/sesame_yogurt_pasta_salad.jpg", "cookTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "", "datePublished": "2011-08-09", "prepTime": "PT10M", "description": "An off-beat pasta salad made with stuffed pasta, seasonal vegetables, and a spice-forward, golden sesame yogurt sauce."}

BUT I always make it by hand, using the above ingredients, and this technique. If you like a super-puffy crust, do the folding in Pim's instructions 4x. I usually like mine less so, and fold &amp; roll just 2 or 3 times, depending on how the dough is feeling. The pie in the photo was 3x.\nBerry Pie Filling\n2/3 cup / 3.5 oz / 100g natural cane or brown sugar\n1/3 cup / 1.5 oz / 45 g flour (apf or wwp)\n1/4 teaspoon fine grain sea salt\n1/2 teaspoon cinnamon\n2 sprigs thyme (prefer. lemon thyme) ~ 1/2 t.\n2 pounds of berries, (see head notes)\n2 tablespoons lemon juice\n2 tablespoons butter\n1 egg plus 1 tablespoon water, whisked\nLarge grain sugar, for sprinkling\nPreheat your oven to 425F / 220C, with a rack in the bottom third. Roll out your pie crust - top and bottom - on a flour dusted counter. I tend to work the edges a bit first (particularly if I'm getting cracks) - roll and turn, roll and turn, dusting with flour when necessary. Flip once or twice. Work quickly and keep the dough moving. Place between unbleached parchment paper or Silpats, and refrigerate while you make the filling. If you're nervous about rolling out the crust, have a look at the second part of Melissa Clark's video. See how she's not super fussy? Channel some of that. If you need an extra confidence booster, read this. It's o.k. if your dough doesn't roll out into a perfect circle - you can patch and pinch later if needed. Just shoot for 11 or 12-inch inch rounds.\nMake the filling by combining the sugar, flour, salt, cinnamon, and thyme in large mixing bowl. Add the berries, and toss gently until well combined. Set aside.\nLine a 9 or 10-inch pie plate with the bottom piece of pie dough. Guide it into place without stretching. You want about an inch of dough extending past the rim of the pie plate, trim a bit with scissors or a sharp knife if needed.\nFill the crust with the berries, drizzle with lemon juice, and dot with the butter. Brush the rim of the bottom crust with a bit of egg wash, then top with the other piece of pie crust. Trim the top crust a bit if needed, then press the top and bottom crusts together at the edges. Working around the rim, tuck the overhanging dough under itself, and crimp with a fork or flute using your fingers (see picture up above). Brush the crust with more of the egg wash, cut a few slits into the top, and place in the oven for about 45 minutes - until the crust is deeply golden. Check your pie regularly after 25 minutes. If you need to foil the edges of the pie - pull it out and do so - this way the edges wont get too dark and dry. I don't have to foil in my oven for this pie, even at this temp, but your oven might be a bit different. I also sprinkle with large-grain sugar about 25 minutes in - for a little extra crunch and sweetness. Let cool a bit, slice and serve.\nServes 8.\n\nPrep time: 90 min  - \n   Cook time: 45 min   \n  \nPrint Recipe", "url": "http://www.101cookbooks.com/archives/a-nice-berry-pie-recipe.html", "image": "http://www.101cookbooks.com/mt-static/images/food/berry_pie_recipe.jpg", "cookTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "", "datePublished": "2011-09-07", "prepTime": "PT90M", "description": "My go-to berry pie recipe - a rye flour crust and mixed berry filling seasoned with fresh thyme leaves."}
